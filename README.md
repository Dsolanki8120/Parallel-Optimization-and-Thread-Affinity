# Parallel-Optimization-and-Thread-Affinity
To find the optimal core assignment for three compute threads (T_0, T_1, T_2) running on a system with only two physical cores and 2-way SMT (four logical cores: 0, 1, 2, 3). The goal was to maximize performance by strategically managing SMT resource sharing versus contention
