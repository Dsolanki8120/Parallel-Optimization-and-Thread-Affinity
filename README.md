Part 1: Parallel Optimization and False Sharing Diagnosis


In first part daignosing why the supposedly "fully parallel" program was performing poorly (∼51.5 ms total time). Our analysis revealed that the performance bottleneck was False Sharing due to the memory layout of the shared output structure

=====================  Problem ========================================================

Cache line contention :  is a performance issue that occurs in multi- core systems when multiple  processors or thread  compete for access the same cache line .causing delays and performance degradation 


Solution of this problem :  -------------------------------------------

  Data Alignment: Aligning data structures so that frequently accessed independent variables reside on different cache lines can reduce false sharing

  Padding: Explicitly padding data structures can ensure that independent data elements are separated onto different cache lines, preventing false sharing 
  

  ------------------------ After padding performance gain (speedup gained) --------------------------------------

speedp gain:   Speedup=  Time before padding/ Time after padding

                Speedup= 51.66ms/ 10.55 ms = 4.90 ms 

                optimization resulted in an approximate 4.9× speedup over the initial, broken parallel implementation.
